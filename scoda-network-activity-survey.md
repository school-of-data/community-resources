## Let’s begin

This is a short survey to get a general idea of the activity of the School of Data network, and an understanding of the projects you’re working on. This will help us find members we should connect because they work on similar projects, for example. 

The survey also allows the Coordination team to get feedback about how we communicate with the network, in order to constantly improve.
